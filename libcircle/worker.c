    /* To get here when using the termination allreduce, we can be sure

     * cleanup.  This was not immediately obvious, so here is a proof
     * to convince myself:
     *
     * Assumptions (requirements):
     * a) A process only makes progress on the current termination
     *    reduction when its queue is empty or it is in abort state.
     * b) If a process is in abort state, it does not transfer work.
     * c) If a process transferred work at any point before sending
     *    to its parent, it will force a new reduction iteration after
     *    the work has been transferred to the new process by setting
     *    its reduction flag to 0.
     *
     * Question:
     * - Can a process have an outstanding work transfer at the point
     *   it receives 1 from the termination allreduce?
     *
     * Answer: No (why?)
     * In order to send to its parent, this process (X) must have an
     * empty queue or is in the abort state.  If it transferred data
     * before calling the reduction, it would set its flag=0 and
     * force a new reduction iteration.  So to get a 1 from the
     * reduction it must not have transferred data before sending to
     * its parent.  If the process was is abort state, it cannot have
     * transferred work after sending to its parent, so it can only be
     * that its queue must have been empty, then it sent flag=1 to its
     * parent, and then transferred work.
     *
     * For its queue to have been empty and then for it to have
     * transferred work later, it must have received work items from
     * another process (Y).  If that sending process (Y) was from a
     * process yet to contribute its flag to the allreduce, the current
     * iteration would return 0, so it must be from a process that had
     * already contributed a 1.  For that process (Y) to have sent 1 to
     * its own parent, it must have an empty queue or be in the abort
     * state.  If it was in abort state, it could not have transferred
     * work, so it must have had an empty queue, meaning that it must
     * have acquired the work items from another process (Z) and
     * process Z cannot be either process X or Y.
     *
     * We can apply this logic recursively until we rule out all
     * processes in the tree, i.e., no process yet to send to its
     * parent and no process that has already sent a 1 to its parent,
     * and of course if any process had sent 0 to its parent, then
     * the allreduce will not return 1 on that iteration.
     *
     * Thus, there is no need to cleanup work transfer or termination
     * allreduce messages at this point. */
